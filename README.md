# repo-sentinel

Reusable GitHub Actions workflow that scans your repos with **Trivy** (dependency vulns, secrets, misconfig) and **CodeQL** (semantic code analysis), then creates GitHub issues for findings and can also keep a sticky PR comment updated on pull request runs. Both issue assignment and PR comments can optionally tag **Copilot** to help remediate findings.

## Install

From your project root:

```bash
# bash / macOS / Linux
curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/codywilliamson/repo-sentinel/main/install.sh | bash

# powershell / Windows
irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/codywilliamson/repo-sentinel/main/install.ps1 | iex
```

Options:

```bash
./install.sh --ref "main" --languages "javascript-typescript,csharp" --threshold "HIGH" --pr-comment-copilot
```

This drops a thin caller workflow into `.github/workflows/security-scan.yml` — all scanning logic stays in this repo. Installers support `--ref` / `-Ref` so you can stay on rolling `main` or pin a release tag for controlled upgrades.

## How it works

```
push/PR/schedule
  ├─ Trivy scan ──────► SARIF ──► GitHub Security tab
  ├─ CodeQL analysis ─► SARIF ──► GitHub Security tab
  └─ Process findings
       ├─ Create/update sticky PR comment on PR runs (optional)
       ├─ Filter by severity threshold (default: MEDIUM+)
       ├─ Deduplicate against existing open issues
       ├─ Create GitHub issues with vuln details + remediation
       └─ Assign/tag Copilot (if enabled)
```

## Configuration

All options are set in the caller workflow (`security-scan.yml` in your repo):

| Input | Default | Description |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| `severity-threshold` | `MEDIUM` | Minimum severity to create issues (`LOW`, `MEDIUM`, `HIGH`, `CRITICAL`) |
| `codeql-languages` | `javascript-typescript` | Comma-separated CodeQL languages |
| `assign-copilot` | `true` | Auto-assign issues to Copilot Coding Agent |
| `comment-pr-findings` | `true` | Create or update a sticky PR comment on pull request runs |
| `pr-comment-copilot-tag` | `false` | Tag `@copilot` in the PR comment when findings are present |
| `trivy-scanners` | `vuln,secret,misconfig` | Trivy scanner types |
| `trivy-skip-dirs` | `""` | Directories to skip |
| `label` | `security` | Label applied to created issues |
| `dry-run` | `false` | Log findings without creating issues |
| `create-issues` | `true` | Enable/disable issue creation while still allowing PR comments |

### Supported CodeQL languages

`javascript-typescript`, `python`, `go`, `java-kotlin`, `csharp`, `ruby`, `cpp`, `swift`

## Triggers

The installed workflow runs on:
- Push to `main`
- Pull requests targeting `main`
- Weekly schedule (Monday 6am UTC)
- Manual dispatch from the Actions tab

On pull request runs, repo-sentinel can keep one sticky PR comment updated with the latest findings summary. This avoids comment spam while still making scan results visible in the conversation.

## Upgrade path

Existing installs are easy to update because the caller workflow is intentionally thin.

1. Re-run the installer and overwrite `.github/workflows/security-scan.yml`, or manually update the `uses:` line in that file.
2. Choose your ref strategy:
   - `@v0.1.0` to stay pinned to the current baseline release
   - `@main` for rolling updates while the next release is being prepared
   - `@<new-release-tag>` once the next tagged release is published
3. Decide how you want to adopt PR comments:
   - Repos pinned to `@v0.1.0` keep the legacy issue-only behavior until they move to a newer ref
   - Repos updated to `@main` or a newer release can leave `comment-pr-findings: true` to enable sticky PR comments
   - Set `comment-pr-findings: false` if you want to keep the legacy issue-only behavior after updating
   - Set `pr-comment-copilot-tag: true` if you also want the PR comment to tag `@copilot`

Example rolling-update caller:

```yaml
jobs:
  security-scan:
    uses: codywilliamson/repo-sentinel/.github/workflows/security-scan.yml@main
    with:
      comment-pr-findings: false
```

For release notes and planned changes, see [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md).

## Requirements

- Repo must be on GitHub with Actions enabled
- For Copilot auto-fix: enable [Copilot Coding Agent](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/using-github-copilot/using-copilot-coding-agent) on the repo
- This repo must be **public** (so reusable workflows are accessible cross-repo)
